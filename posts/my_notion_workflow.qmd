I have talked quite a lot about HAVING my "automation" system in @NotionHQ. While I try a multitude of other apps as a passion project, most of them are not modifiable for my needs.

This a thread about insights into MY (a) needs, (b) system, (c) automation, and, (d) thoughts.
1. NEEDS

In short, I want a cheap app w/ online, collaborative, all-in-one, UI/UX, integrations, bidirectional linking.

Background: I am a CS AI/ML PhD researcher (moving to a full-time industry research position in mid-2023). I have ADHD & have very specific needs for an app.
2. SYSTEM

2a. Notion Organization | Workspaces

‚ú® The biggest change I am making from 2022 to 2023 is using 2 MAIN workspaces.

‚ùìI hate search to be cluttered with database entries that do not need to be pages.

üìçTip: Duplicate templates to another workspace to avoid clutter.
2b. Notion Organization | Main Workspace Teamspaces

I used to have a separate page for all dashboards. Since notion introduced "teamspaces" for education plans, all my teamspaces are dashboard views of databases.
2b (Contd.) Tips

üìç Delete all trash (https://github.com/axyyu/notion-clear-trash) is a lifesaver, mine activates using an arc boost when I load a certain page.

üìç All Purpose Inbox to clip anything

üìç Inbox cleanup to frequently clean/tag databases
2c. Notion Organization | Main Workspace Sidebar

(Click on image to view all)

My main databases are divided into common, personal, work and storage.

‚ú® I used to have tracking databases here, but now I just have tracking logs as simple tables for each tracked item.
2c. Contd.

‚ùìI do not use a label database because I need color and I need a fixed set of options per database (relations cannot be filtered).

Tips:
üìç Attach a symbol to easily distinguish between page and database (e.g. ‚ùè represents databases)
2c. Contd.

üìç Use apps w/ integration. I can clip an article into notion and have a subpar reading experience, or I can instead just use Reader or Matter.

üìç Avoid logging to main workspace. When there are 200 pages of "Wake up before 8am", searching "wake up" is useless.
2d. Notion Organization | Automation Workspace Teamspaces

Other than life tracking, I track uncommon "properties" especially relevant to people w/ ADHD.

 1. Number of times I reschedule task/event reschedule to keep myself in check.
2. Missed deadlines & cancelled tasks/events.
2d. Contd.

‚ùì Why not use a habit tracker with habits as properties and days as pages? Because I hate having missing data and it is harder to automate. Also, it is harder to have non-daily habits

Tips:
üìçMake tracking easy for yourself. Gather data from apps you already use.
3. AUTOMATION

3a. Issues w/ Notion:

From the needs section above, Notion does not tick many of those boxes.

The main pain points being:
(a) quick add w/ tags and relations (mobile-friendly)
(b) property autofill & duplicates
(c) task view
(d) linked content peek/multipanel
3.1a Todoist

And so, in comes @todoist. Todoist has the best labelling and scheduling system for quick add I have ever seen.

And trust me, I have tried 100+ other apps (not @lazyappHQ though, yet).
3.1b Todoist Setup

Yes. I have these many projects and I have maintained this with little effort for over 2 years.

Tips:
üìçIndicators. Everything has some form of indicator. I use W,P,L for work, personal, life. Tracking projects have ‚†î. Orange person for shared projects.
3.1c Todoist Labels

Quick Add is awesome using todoist because adding labels requires no clicks, and is fuzzy-ish search.

I use 200+ labels.

‚ú® I created new relationship labels to add to the most recently edited "in progress" record in a db (papers to a project etc.)
3.1c Contd.

‚ÑπÔ∏è Notations.

I use ^ to define projects that label can be used in.
.f are functional labels (sync, relations etc)
.p are labels that are assigned to a particular property like status

Projects map to a database (usually 1-1)
Sections map to a select property.
3.2a Sync & Quick Add

My setup for 2022 used GAS w/ Google Sheets to maintain maps between todoist labels, projects, sections to notion databases, properties & property values.

Cons: Adding a new project/db/label was a hassle.

‚ú® Using Notion & Shortcuts for Mapping Db w/ GAS
3.2b Autofill w/ scripts

‚ùì I don't use zapier/make for automation because (a) One thing I do know in life is to code, and, (b) It is too expensive imo.

I use multiple scripts for autofilling different things, especially, (a) academic papers,
(b) entertainment,
(c) library.
3.2c Auto manage w/ shortcuts

2. I use shortcuts to autofill title (when there is no obvious name for a page (or the name is a combination of properties). and change default icon to blue dot.
3.3a Page Automations

1. ‚ûï subpages as mentions to a toggle on top of page or to a subpages property.
2. ‚ûï all inline todos to the tasks database & sync their status.
3. ‚ûï all mentions as relations if property exists with referencing content as synced block
3.3c Task View & Context

Now given all tasks are in my tasks db, they sync to todoist. I can access them from todoist, or notion, or through ANY other todoist integration (LIKE Gcal).

They have notion block links attached that are accessible to see task in context.
3.4 Peeks and Backlinks

Backlinks get content as shown above.

Page peek is one problem I found no solution for. When @NotionHQ introduced peeks, I was hoping they would work for pages too.

I can thankfully peek for database pages now, so adding related inline views works.
4. THOUGHTS

4a. Schema

I refreshed multiple things for this year. Especially adding desired sync/quick add function as labels instead of a messy GAS script.

My databases are also more specific in their schema now. I can easily shift to Tana/Capacities if I want to.
4b. Venting

As much as I use notion, I don't love it.

I hate square checkboxes & use CSS extensions to fix them to bootstrapped rounded ones.

I do not like how relations cannot be filtered or not having properties access inside a page, or missing task view, (or pages as tasks)
4c. External Apps

None of the common apps have canvas that works well with ipad/handwriting. So freeform, goodnotes and @MuseAppHQ it is for the moment.

I export the content and then embed in Notion (or sync file with google drive and embed link to get updates).
4d. Testing Apps

For notes: @capacitiesHQ, @tana_inc, @wallingapp and maybe @saga_HQ, @cloverappco and @xTilesHQ. None of these fulfill all I want though.

Canvas apps are all the rage now, so hopefully @MuseAppHQ comes up with integrations.
All in all, I would be lying if I said it was all done quickly. It took me ages to build this system up.

But any system without automation/auto-fill/connections/relations is unfortunately too much of a mental barrier for me to use and I revert to using google docs.
