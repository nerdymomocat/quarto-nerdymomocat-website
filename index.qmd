## Scratches and Scribbles 
To try something new, I am also aiming to do intentional, requested app walkthroughs, comments, and suggestions; focusing on features and usability. Look at [my post](posts/scratches_and_scribbles.qmd) to know more about what I look at, my background, my use-case, and my pre-conceived notions, as well as for social proof. If you think I should take a look at your app, shoot me a [DM](https://twitter.com/nerdymomocat) or an [email](mailto:nerdymomocat@gmail.com).

I'm passionate about all things personal knowledge management. I'm all about linking knowledge snippets, coding and automations, note taking and sketchnoting.

Whether I'm helping others streamline their workflows and optimize their productivity, or experimenting with new tools to improve my own processes, I'm always exploring new ways to get the most out of my digital life.

My personal tools at the moment are: Notion, Todoist and Goodnotes, but I am always exploring other tools.
