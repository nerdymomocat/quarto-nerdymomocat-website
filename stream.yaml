  subtitle: The main concern is that current databases cannot be ported over to this new feature. And I am kinda okay with it?
  description: "I think it's a new user onboarding feature. It's kinda similar to buying templates from people, just that this one is made by <i>Notion</i> and has some features inbuilt. This feature isn't really meant for people who customize their systems heavily or for those who already have established systems.<br><br>One way to approach this is by asking myself: Do I want this company to make money and stay alive? If the answer is yes, I just make peace with it. On the other hand, if I don't like the direction things are taking, I look for an alternative.<br><br>It's worth noting that if companies don't focus on making money, they often end up shutting down. And here I am, working in research and choosing to make less money in return for increased, well, let's call it <b>misery</b>."

  categories: [Notion, PKM, Tasks]
  description: "I've been using Notion primarily for long-form documents that have properties. So, for anything that requires extended content, Notion works fine for me. <br><br> However, when it comes to tasks, journalling, or lists, I find myself unintentionally avoiding the platform. I really dislike using Notion for tasks. Writing a 'done' list feels like a chore, and linking pages feels pointless because that information just seems to disappear. <br><br>And yeah, that makes me kind of sad."

  subtitle: Based on my experience with Notion, I have quickly realized, I do not really like how Notion handles pages. But I am waiting to switch.
  description: "There's obviously a hint of a struggle within me; I really like <i>Notion</i> and don't want to leave. My hesitation mainly comes from a keen interest in how different apps are going to integrate AI. To me, the low-hanging fruit of integration, like synthesis during content creation, is incredibly dull. I absolutely don't care about it. What I'm truly waiting for is to see how these apps will handle the transformation of unstructured content into structured forms and semantic searches."

  subtitle: I have been sharing tips and tricks and templates over the course of past year on Twitter, but now the links are gonna change.
  description: "Why? Because I wanted to change the workspace where my <i>Notion</i> templates were hosted. And I wanted to change my homepage. Most URL shorteners do not allow you to edit the destination URL for free. So, I found a great <a href='https://github.com/younho9/notion-url-shortener'>repo on GitHub</a> built by <i>younho_9</i>.<br><br>And now, I can edit the URL in my <i>Notion</i> database and still shorten all the URLs. That is <b>awesome</b>!"

  subtitle: Everything in one app serves me till it does not.
  description: "I am one of those people who cannot handle multiple apps that do the same thing. Whether they are for personal or professional use, if both apps are about tasks, then it's really tough for me to use both. However, I've realized that I can manage multiple apps if they serve very <i>specific</i>, compartmentalized purposes. For example, I want my journal and personal databases to be interconnected, but do I really need my shopping list to be linked up? It serves no purpose being in my <i>PKM</i> app.<br><br> Take bookmarks, for instance. It's quite a hassle to have bookmarks in Notion, and I'm considering alternatives like Chrome bookmarks or Raindrop. So, in short, it's all about compartmentalizing your digital life to make things less complicated. <br><br>"

  subtitle: I really cannot do note-taking apps that aren't true WYSIWYG
  description: "Obsidian has a live preview option that lets me see everything rendered except for the line I'm editing. This really bothers me. It feels like writing a paper in <i>LaTeX</i>, which I don't enjoy. For me, note-taking needs to be enjoyable. It should be free from wild context shifts, messy layouts, and metadata clutter. I even struggle with simple tasks like having differently colored highlights without them showing up as text. So, it's just not going to work for me."

  subtitle: I cannot think and type at the same time!
  description: "Something just clicked for me right now, at midnight. I can't think and type at the same time. I can think and blabber out loud, even though blabbering is slower, but it's not enough of a difference to hamper my thinking.<br><br>This is similar to how reading out loud makes some people struggle with processing what they are reading, especially when their internal reading doesn't match the speed of their speaking abilities. But blabbering produces a <i>huge</i> wall of text, just like this one!<br><br>It gets even worse when I am reading a paper, for example, and I have thoughts about parts of it. In an ideal world, I will circle them, scribble around for context, but cropping them and typing out my comment 100% breaks the flow for me. And I can't read and process huge walls of text.<br><br>This is what I've been struggling with. This is why I scribble down stuff because scribbling down with colors and pens in a spatial manner makes it way easier for me to relate stuff, to pick bits and pieces that would go together. It makes it easy for me to read and process it once I am done with the dumping. Unfortunately, it makes it harder for me later organize it, search it, or document it.<br><br>I don't know how I had this realization, but it is so <i>fascinating</i> and <i>disappointing</i> at the same time."

They let you add summaries and even do QA, but tags? NOPE, they don't do them here. <i>NotionHQ</i>, <i>readwise</i>, can we get some AI tags please? Sure, <i>tana_inc</i> does it, but that's beside the point. <i>obsdmd</i> does too through plain text, and I assume some AI plugin + templater combo, but I'm not looking for UI on top of plain text filters right now. Let me tag my content with AI, it's one of the things it's good at!<br><br>Gmail, listen up. I don't really want to write an email with AI; I want to add labels to the email with AI.

  categories: [Notes, Tasks, Tools]
  subtitle: I like it a lot but it needs a ton of stuff to be my day-to-day app.
  description: "I got access to Superlist about a month ago. I generally don't write about apps unless I've spent some quality time with them. The core concept of Superlist is like if <i>Notion</i> or <i>Apple Notes</i> had calendar views, scheduling, and checkbox assignments. It reminds me a lot of <i>ColumnsApp</i>. What I appreciate about it is the focus on collaboration; I can't really work with a personal to-do app. Plus, it's multi-platform, which is a must for me. On the integrations side, it's decent; my go-to app, <i>Todoist</i>, doesn't offer much beyond Google Calendar integration.<br><br>Tasks, Notes (including files and attachments), and Comments are all centralized, which is honestly fantastic. This is the core reason I wanted to check out Superlist, and it delivers. The UI for managing tasks, comments, scheduling, tags, and lists is really well done. Everything shows up in an Inbox that can be filtered, scheduled, and tagged, making task management a breeze.<br><br>So why am I not committed yet? The app lacks export options, activity logs, watch apps, task statuses beyond a basic checkbox, quick capture options (Todoist really spoiled me there), limited keyboard shortcuts, and doesn't display subtask progress. It also has some syncing issues similar to <i>Todoist</i>. Despite these drawbacks, I think it's a pretty solid app. It treats tasks as first-class citizens, unlike many note-taking apps, while still maintaining a lot of to-do app features. Once it's out of beta, I think it's going to attract a lot of attention. I'm eager to see how it evolves."

  subtitle: Why most AI writing tools miss the mark for advanced editing needs.
  description: "Anyone has suggestions for <i>in-background</i> AI-based document editing apps? I don't need the app to tell me what to write next. What I'm looking for is an app that suggests changes like, <i>'This needs rephrasing to connect well to another section,'</i> or <i>'Merge these two repeated sections.'</i> I think my gripe with AI writing tools is that they're very generative rather than being aids for editing.<br><br> It's like someone misunderstood the term <i>generative AI</i> and decided that content generation is its best use. But writing a 5k+ token paper in my voice? That's a whole other ball game. It would need a strong mix of vectorization, concept mapping, segmentation, and context addition to be truly helpful as an editor. I understand that achieving this level of sophistication is extremely difficult. Still, I find myself continually trying out these tools, secretly hoping for a miracle because, let's face it, I hate editing."

I simply highlight and quote. Oh, and I also don't do booknotes. When reading on my <i>Kindle</i>, I sometimes highlight stuff and sync it through <i>Readwise</i>. I don't do podcast notes either, opting for podcast snips instead. For the 3rd model, most of my 'note-taking' is actually replaced by AI extraction. For example, I ask what the Research Questions (RQs) are in a particular paper. The only notes I do write are focused on processes (how to do something), understanding (what's involved), or questions/ideas related to my work. For me, any other written notes just serve as search pointers. I do write a lot outside of note-taking, like blogs, journals, letters, and academic papers."

The latest app in the list is <a href='http://browser.horse'>browser.horse</a>, thanks to <i>PascalPixel</i> who very kindly allowed me to test the app a few months back.

And it does it perfectly.<br><br>On the worst of days, I have had 200+ tabs open in Horse; on the best, at least a 100. And it has been pretty stable for all of it.

  subtitle: The pros and cons of using Google Workspace for note-taking and tasks
  description: "I tried using <i>Google Workspace</i> as an alternative to <i>Notion</i> and, although I appreciate many of its features, I've decided it's not the right fit for me right now. I have several reasons for liking <i>Google Workspace</i>: it functions offline, almost everyone has a Google account, and its integration with <i>Bard</i> is seamless. Features such as toggles, previews, markdown-based writing, and rich text are also invaluable. The tasks functionality, although not free, is impressive as they can be linked with Google tasks, mentioned in chats, and synced from documents. I find Sheets+API information straightforward, and the ease of handling data through inline dropdowns & places is superior to <i>Notion</i>. Its offline capability, compatibility with <i>Google Calendar, Meet, Keep, Google Apps Script, Gmail</i> integrations, outline on the side pane, and summary are features I truly adore.<br><br>However, there are some areas where <i>Google Workspace</i> falls short for me. I prefer the toggles in <i>Notion</i>, as Google Docs' toggles are restricted to headings. The use of embeds, callouts, and block-based editors is something I am accustomed to and enjoy in <i>Notion</i>. I miss features like synced blocks and block mentions, and I'm not a fan of viewing <i>Google Drive</i> as a cluttered space with numerous files. <i>Notion</i>'s user experience, especially when opening a page with the same sidebar, feels more cohesive. Another concern is the storage aspect; uploading to Google consumes my storage while <i>Notion</i> offers it for free. I'm more familiar with the <i>Notion API</i>, making it easier for me than <i>Google Docs API</i>. Public content presentation in <i>Notion</i> also feels superior to GDocs.<br><br>Perhaps in the future, if I become more comfortable with the editor and the absence of certain block features, I might reconsider <i>Google Workspace</i>. It encompasses many features I desire from <i>Notion</i>, particularly task collection and an advanced AI search via <i>Bard</i> for GDrive. This post did enlighten me: if I could ever tolerate the sight of 10k randomly scattered files, <i>Google Workspace</i> would be my go-to. Surprisingly, I even prefer it over <i>Obsidian</i>, which further narrows down my options."
