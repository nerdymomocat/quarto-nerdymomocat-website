Read more about Beeper Widgets here.\n\nBeeper Widgets are web apps shown inside Beeper that can interact with chat data, like reading messages, seeing participants, and sending or reacting to messages on your behalf. Our widgets are standard web apps built with React, so developers have full freedom to create any interface, interact with other services, and do anything else a website can."

    "text": "Introduction\nWhen @Beth messaged me that she has invites for Texts; I was excited.\n\n\n\nTexts invitation from Beth 2023-06-24\n\n\nI was equally excited about getting off Beeper’s waitlist a little over a month ago.\n\n\n\nInvitation from Beeper 2023-05-18\n\n\n\nWhy did I even want to try Texts?\nWell, if you are reading this, you know this is my alt account. While I do not have multiple apps that I run alt accounts for, Twitter is definitely one of them. And Beeper at the moment does not support multiple accounts for the same app.\nAs I have said before, I am very much a person who values utility over design; and especially would prefer free software that still works over paid beautiful ones (that also work, mind you).\n\n\nWhat about Texts not having a mobile app?\nWhile I do have Beeper installed on my phone, Texts not having a mobile app is not a deal breaker for me. This is specifically because the I do have per app notifications for personal messaging turned on. Hence, the benefit of Beeper comes to be in the extras — which I will talk about later, but in this case, is just scheduling; which I do use if need be.\n\n\nPricing\nTexts pricing is a concern for me, though thankfully their education pricing is okay by me — which at the moment is $5/mo. Beeper at the moment is free, though comes with a very very extensive waitlist. They do propose to have paid plans in the future, and if it is anywhere in the range of $5/mo, I will pay for it.\ntl;dr — I think $5/mo for messaging aggregator app is where I place the value to be."

    "text": "Design Comparison\nLet’s get this out of the way. I know many people care about this and I do want to touch on it, because that is one of the major out-of-box difference between Texts and Beeper.\nDesign decisions of course affect the UI/UX of individual actions and I will discuss them while I discuss the functionality. This section is solely focussed on the looks, and not the UX of the two apps.\n\nBasic Looks\nTexts feels like a “beautiful app” out of box. On the other hand Beeper feels like a hacker version of Texts. Now, none of this is to say, one is more or less stable than the other. Of course you can modify CSS in Beeper but no immediate changes makes it look comprehensive.\nThere are of course differences in the setup page, but I do not care about it. You need to setup things ONCE. And yes, texts looks much better in that regard. Reduced number of popups, consistent design etc. But again, you will access it only once.\n\n\n\nTexts UI out of box looks way cleaner than Beeper’s\n\n\n\n\nWhat bothers me?\nI am not the kind of person to care about Apple-esque design. If you are, then Beeper isn’t for you. That being said, there are still multiple things that bother me in Beeper’s design.\n\nThe message preview in the sidebar can be one or two lines making it feel inconsistent\nThe use of You on left and ticks/double-ticks misaligns the whole preview and very much prefers Texts implementation here. Even when the words (You) do not exist, the text in some cases does not align to the contact’s name. Presence of tick/double-tick signifies that it was sent by you anyway.\nChat settings open in a new modal on top of everything? Why?\nSchedule send has an orange colored huge button, why?\nThere is no visual gradient or information in the sidebar list to identify which chat is opened at the moment.\nSome actions such as search inside a chat or favorite a chat are hidden in the top menu bar of Beeper. That to me makes no sense!\n\n\n\n\nClick on the gif to see the menu bar actions and search UX\n\n\n\nApp indicator on the right has an outlined mode and I don’t think I like it though it is easily fixable through CSS.\nLow priority and archive should be up there with categories but it isn’t. There isn’t a need for a floating “Open Archives” button.\nThe sidebar opens with a stack icon which still confuses me. I would prefer a standardized icon like a hamburger menu.\nGroup chats show who sent the last message which is awesome but also shows their contact picture and it just makes a mess."

    "section": "Functionality Comparison",
    "text": "Functionality Comparison\n\nSupported Apps\n\nBeeper:  \nTexts:  \n\nBeeper supports more apps: specifically Google Chat, Instagram and android SMS are notably missing from Texts. This is important to me, because I do plan to shift to Android, and I would want my sms to be available on Mac. Also important because, while iMessage does already have a desktop sync component, google messages does not have one on Mac, and Beeper does shine there.\nGoogle Chat is important for me as someone in education, where the university, my lab and colleagues; all use chat often for varying purposes.\nInstagram has been constantly buggy; even for Beeper, but not longer than 2 days (the last time it happened, it was buggy for 12-ish hours). I believe that is due Meta’s API issues, but Beeper has fixed connections faster than Texts. I can assume that because while Instagram is back on Beeper, it is still missing from Texts.\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate speed in Beeper\n\n\n\niMessages\n\nBeeper: \nTexts:  \n\nTexts needs an extra helper for keeping the messages synced. I believe that is because they are extracting or intercepting rather than syncing through an extra server as Beeper is. That allows Beeper. That is one of the main reasons why you can have iMessage on Android/Windows in Beeper, and is unlikely to come anytime soon to Texts. Personally, when I switch back to Android, I do not need iMessage and I will not care about this. Google messages on the other hand allows for a QR code based login (similar to whatsapp) — and I am disappointed that does not exist on Texts.\n\n\n\nSpeed and Updates\n\nBeeper: \nTexts: \n\nWhile Beeper in usage is snappier (Texts feels slower to me) — Beeper’s startup time from being closed as an app to starting up is atrocious. Thankfully I never shut down my laptop and my messaging app is never closed, so I do not really care about this. The only caveat to this being — Beeper literally sends out new updates every single day (sometimes twice a day); and once it does update, you have to put up with the slow startup speed (takes a minute or two).\n\n\nActions\n\nArchive\n\nBeeper:  \nTexts: \n\nWhile both Beeper and Texts allow for archiving a conversation, only Texts allows for syncing state of the archive with the native platform. Texts also has an option of “Move to Other” and “Hide” which kind of do the same thing — and I am not really sure if they need to exist. But more options for organizing the cluttered inbox has never hurt anyone!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit Messages\n\nBeeper:  \nTexts: \n\nBoth Beeper and Texts support editing a text message on platforms that do support it. Unfortunately because Beeper does not have a platform specific context menu, sometimes you might try editing a message and end up with an error.\n\n\nMark as Unread\n\nBeeper: \nTexts: \n\nBoth Beeper and Texts have an option to mark a conversation as unread, neither of which syncs back to the native platform. Texts has an add on feature here called “Stealth mode” that lets you keep a conversation remain marked as unread even if you click on it and read it; unless you reply to them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDelete Conversation\n\nBeeper: \nTexts: \n\nTexts provides a feature to delete a complete conversation. This is especially useful for spam twitter conversations. While Beeper does put them automatically in to the low priority inbox (invites box for Texts) — you cannot delete the conversation/thread and I do not like that. Delete thread/conversation entirely does not seem to sync state with the original app and that is a bummer.\n\n\nSelect multiple messages\n\nBeeper: \nTexts: \n\nTexts allows you to select multiple messages using Shift + ↑ which you can then use to copy, remind, forward or delete (not shown here because these are tips inbox) and that is amazing. I have yet to find this functionality in Beeper, and quite possibly it does not exist.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDelete Message\n\nBeeper: \nTexts:  \n\nBoth Beeper and Texts supports deleting a message, but only texts separately shows Delete for everyone vs Delete for me in Whatsapp, which is not important to me, but an attention to detail I can appreciate. These deletes are synced with the server (so you do see a similar state when you open the corresponding app)\n\n\nForward Message\n\nBeeper: \nTexts:  \n\nBoth Texts and Beeper allow you to forward a message. Both allow you to forward a message to multiple users. While Texts does this as a popup modal, Beeper does this in sidebar for some reason; and I prefer Texts implementation here.\n\n\nReply to Message\n\nBeeper:  \nTexts: \n\nBoth Beeper and Texts supports replying to a message and the, so that is awesome! Beeper adds an extra option to view thread when there are a series of replies in a thread.\n\n\nOpen Conversation in Corresponding App\n\nBeeper: \nTexts:  \n\nWhile most people might not find a use case for this; I would have heavily used this feature in 2 days. Whatsapp does not allow for calling through third party clients. Being able to open a conversation in Whatsapp to call my mom when she has called me 80 times; always helps. Trust me; it saves her a minute of panic attacks. But texts seems to be able to open webapps but not on desktop apps?\nTexts also has a chrome extension that allows you to open a chat on twitter or other web platforms back in the texts app — and that is another one I appreciate.\n\n\n\nContent\n\nSearch\n\nBeeper: \nTexts: \n\nWhile both apps allow for searching across all chats and across a single chat; I prefer the design choice of Texts. Additionally, search in Texts highlights the word in a message whereas in beeper it just shows relevant messages.\n\n\nMedia\n\nBeeper: \nTexts:  \n\nIn Texts, the files and media section does not load media (or messages for that matter) before install date unless and until you scroll up the message viewport to an earlier date. I wish there was a setting to specify the earliest date you want to load messages from, but that does not seem to be the case.\n\n\nCall and Video\n\nBeeper: \nTexts: \n\nBeeper seems to support call and video for certain channels. It is not apparent to me, which ones those are — given I do not use Slack and Discord. It does not seem to support Messenger or Whatsapp for calling. Texts does not provide any notifications for incoming calls and that is a huge bummer.\n\n\nNotifications\n\nBeeper:  \nTexts: \n\nBoth Beeper and Texts have an app level notification setting and a conversation level notification setting. Beeper also has other kinds of notification settings, which I assume are really powerful for slack and discord — both of which I do not use at the moment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd On Features\n\nSend Later\n\nBeeper:  Schedule and dismiss\nTexts:   Schedule when app is active, dismiss and reschedule\n\nSend later in Texts relies on the desktop being powered on and the app running. I believe they store it as an action on device. While on Beeper, you can instead send messages later because those actions are stored on their server.\nDue to this difference in system, while send later is more convenient on Beeper, it also has a poor UX. When you schedule a message in Beeper, it disappears back into the button. You also cannot schedule two messages to the same person, which in my opinion is fine. On Texts, it shows up inline and feels way more native to the app itself. You can also not reschedule a message in Beeper (fine by me, I will just copy paste); while you can do so in Texts.\n\n\n\n\n\nSchedule send UI in Beeper and how the scheduled send ends up looking like inside the Beeper interface\n\n\n\n\n\nSend Later UI in Texts and how the scheduled send ends up looking like inside the Beeper interface\n\n\n\n\nView Thread\n\nBeeper: \nTexts: \n\nBeeper allows you to show thread in a consecutive set of replies. Honestly, that has been a life-saver for me. As someone who often tends to have multiple conversations in parallel with the same person, show thread allows me to skim over the conversation way quicker.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuto-copy\n\nBeeper: \nTexts: \n\nOne of the best features of Beeper and Texts is: it auto copies the two factor auth code onto your clipboard to be pasted into the textboxes on the website. Yes, exactly that meme for iPhone but built by Beeper and Texts.\n\n\nAuto-Archive\n\nBeeper: \nTexts: \n\nBoth Beeper and Texts have an option to auto-archive. Texts works in days by default, and Beeper in minutes. Both end up having the same functionality.\n\n\nRemind Later\n\nBeeper: \nTexts:  Single or multiple messages, auto-archive on snooze\n\nThis is completely missing from Beeper unfortunately, and given they are better poised to be doing this (because they have their own servers) — I am disappointed. Remind later shows the same UI as scheduled send, just that in this case: you receive notification again on the set time. You can choose to archive threads that you have set a remind for in general settings. It is very similar to how snooze works in Spark Email.\n\n\nOpenAI integration\n\nBeeper: \nTexts: \n\nTexts has an option to draft replies and to transcribe voice messages through OpenAI. This is a part of their premium plan. I don’t know if I am very excited about that, but one potential usecase might be using the transcription to send to a note-taking app such as Capacities which does have integration with Telegram/Whatsapp.\n\n\nSnippets\n\nBeeper: \nTexts: \n\nCustom snippets or what Texts calls as Quick Replies allows you to create custom templated responses. I will be honest, I do not work in any customer oriented role and I cannot think of any use case for these, though I believe, it might be useful for other people.\n\n\n\n\n\nCreating quick replies in Texts\n\n\n\n\nUndo Send\n\nBeeper: \nTexts:  Specify in seconds 0-10\n\nTexts allows for undo send using Shift + Cmd + Z. This is very much equivalent to undo send in gmail and is awesome. The amount of typo filled messages I write when I am half asleep serves me no good.\n\n\nLabels\n\nBeeper: \nTexts: \n\nTexts supports labels, one of the major organization perks. You can have default labels assigned to a conversation, to an app, and assign labels of your own. Then you can filter or search using these labels through the hamburger menu on the top left.\n\n\n\nKeyboard Shortcuts\n\nBeeper:   Navigation\nTexts:   Navigation and Actions\n\nBeeper, in my experience does not support action based keyboard shortcuts and rather just navigation based shortcuts. So, you have a shortcut for search, a shortcut to move between apps, and between categories, but that is it. Texts on the other hand aims to be completely accessible through keyboard, supporting both navigation (moving through the app) and action (reply, reminders, copy notification, schedule a message, delete etc) through keyboard.\nOne of the best keyboard shortcuts is Focus App (that allows you to bring Texts to the front) instead of opening it through Raycast, and is something I have extensively used in the past 2 days."

    "text": "Personal Knowledge management has remained a subject of discussion since ages. One of the most common way people manage their personal knowledge is spread across email, drive and notes apps. Most people end up using google docs, apple notes, or google keep as a starter. If they want to do something more complicated, they end up with something like Evernote or OneNote. Add another level of complexity and you end up with something similar to Notion, Tana etc. No matter the app chosen and the management philosophy, it all boils down to primitives, capture, processing and actions. So this post is a generalized discussion of these components. I also talk about how AI can contribute or interact with these components in short and long term."

    "section": "Understanding the PKM Primitives",
    "text": "Understanding the PKM Primitives\nPrimitives in my viewpoint are the basic building blocks of any system. In this case we are talking about personal knowledge management systems. Building blocks usually have 2 characteristics: they can be combined to build more complex systems; and they can be used to define the possibilities or infrastructure of any system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApp Primitives\nApp primitives, in my viewpoint are the capabilities or possibilities of a system. These are often implemented on a backend level and not on a content level. It does not matter what the content is, app primitives are most content-agnostic. Some common examples of these are share, collaboration. permissions, history etc. These apply to any content that is present in the app. This is also an implementation that many people are divisive over. For example files over app is a philosophy that is still relevant to app primitives, just that the storage is plaintext or markdown files.\n\n\nContent Primitives\nContent primitives are smaller building blocks that can combine together to create better or more complex systems. Content primitives define a set of actions associated to those “blocks” as well. the content primitives defined above should cover most cases, but one of the best abilities that an app can provide is creating new content primitives specific to the user, such as Notion or Tana. One of the missing aspect for all of these content primitives is default actions and default recognition. For example, task is a common content primitive in many apps — the idea there being that it has at least two states of not done vs done. Or a timestamp has a “change date” action. But there is a dire dearth of content primitives recognized by apps."

    "text": "The Art of Capture\nCapture is a largely unsolved problem. Every time a new capture app comes into picture; there is a reason why everyone is so excited. Capture has many problems to overcome → it has to be quick, it should be in context, it has to work offline, it has to work with multiple modes. Capture can be classified into two categories →capture from integrations or basically data input into a different app that is then pulled into your personal knowledge management system. Snippets on the other hand are content that is meant to be as a direct input into the knowledge system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntegrations\nIntegrations refer to the general idea of having different apps that are specialized; to be later fed into your personal knowledge management system There can be multiple integrations that people have — the most common ones being chat and email. No one expects to be talking through their personal knowledge system (unless you are Google Chat and Spaces), but having integrations ensures that you still get the best experience for the particular component.\nIntegrations tie into various aspects of content primitives. For example, an email integration ideally integrates with person, text and files primitives. The special aspect of any great app is this idea of integration being automated through LLMs or AI; converting this unstructured data input into structured tags or relations with the baseline or user defined content primitives.\n\n\nSnippets\nSnippets are direct input of data. These can either be standalone snippets — for example that note you create about your partner, or can be positioned snippets. Positioned snippets tie back into the content primitives, that is, you have a particular kind of content, their position.\nThere are certain aspects of snippets that are best helped by AI. Consider standalone snippets. OCR, transcription, object recognition are some basic actions that can be performed on these snippets to improve the utility of a PKM. For positioned snippets, something that extracts context and embeds the context within the the captured input is possibly the north star of utility for a PKM app. You want a house in a meme vs house on a street show up in the same context during search or filtering."

    "text": "Unlocking Knowledge Through Processing\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplicit Processing\nExplicit processing refers to the idea of a person manually organizing the content in their PKM in a way that best makes sense. There are multiple ways this kind of processing is facilitated; for example, in the very basic apps, tags and folders are the most prominent methods of explicit processing. Bear and obsidian support hierarchical tags and that improves the kind of organization an app can provide. More complex apps provide linking between “snippets”, rolling up associated information, table of contents as possible processing of the input content.\n\n\nImplicit Processing\nImplicit processing on the other hand is something that a PKM performs in the background. Most apps that exist at the moment have none or barely existent implicit processing. Let’s try an analogy to understand what the very basic ideas of implicit processing is. — “Oh you open google keep everytime you come back from this location” or “It seems like you are not home. Should I turn off all lights” is a self inferred rule by an operating system or through a smart home system. For PKM, this can look like — oh, we create this scrollable mini map on the side that extracts the main theme/idea from each paragraph. Implicit processing is what makes any app seem seamless. While you can go along a fair bit with handcrafted rules, the best implicit processors are guided structuring processes that align with a user’s desired behavior and still run in the background."

    "section": "Actions - The Grand Finale",
    "text": "Actions - The Grand Finale\nActions, as I speak of, are interactions that can occur with or on the data that is stored in a PKM. Actions define how you use the system that you are engaging with. Actions can occur not only on a singular snippet but on a combination of them. Actions and processing are also the key differentiators between choosing different applications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate\nCreating is one of the primary actions that everyone here probably identifies with. Whether you are a content creator or not, creation of notes, long form content, sharing a set of snippets in a post, a listicle, creating easily glanceable information, creating a website, creating a repository, all of forms of creation actions. Creating directly feeds back into processing, given how it is at direct user-level interaction. It is an active action (funny, how active should usually imply actions anyway).\n\n\nConsume\nConsumption is usually the other side of coin for primary actions. Consumption though is a passive action. This hence, does not usually correlate with explicit processing. Learning the behavior of consumption though is a huge deal of processing — for example, if you look up “house”, what do you want to come up in search. This is mostly a form of data log modelling, and beyond the scope of this post.\n\nStructured\nStructured consumption in my perspective refers to a retrieval based action. This can be structured in either its attributes that can be used to filter or correlate, to search or bring up related to information or snippets, plot information on a graph for two related variables etc. I use the word structure specifically to refer to something that has no creation of information. The information all exists and is surfaced as needed.\n\n\nUnstructured\nUnstructured consumption in my opinion is when the app does some kind of synthesis of information. This can be as basic as synthesizing the summary of the snippet (as Notion AI and a million other PKM apps do), can be summarizing or conversing with the content stored in the PKM (such as mem) or can be more integrated into the creation process (such as expand, augment this content). While this is the lowest hanging fruit form of integration, getting a great unstructured integration using AI requires more than just dumping embeddings into a prompt interface, something that many of the current apps do not seem to onboard for.\n\n\n\nRender\nAny personal knowledge management system is a dynamic ecosystem of practical and user-friendly structures. Within this system, you will usually find galleries, boards, timelines, groups (for example in Notion), and flashcards (for example in Anki). These structures serve as valuable resources, containing carefully curated knowledge that is easily accessible and interactive. Galleries act as personalized exhibition spaces, housing a collection of images, diagrams, and multimedia content that are visually appealing and intellectually stimulating. Boards function as brainstorming hubs, enabling you to organize various pieces of information, such as cards, notes, or snippets, in a way that mirrors the natural process of pinning ideas on a bulletin board.\n\n\nModify\nModification actions are essentially changes applied to your content - it could be as simple as editing a typo or deleting an unnecessary file. They could also be higher-level actions, such as marking a task complete or archiving an old document. Modification also has a deep integration with implicit processing, which is what makes processing so difficult to execute correctly. If you add a name to your meeting note attendees, it should record the new information, but now that changes related notes and unstructured consumption of information about this person."

Processing can be explicit (manual organization) or implicit (background processing by the PKM). Actions, such as creating and consuming content, are how users interact with the PKM.

For instance, you might be looking for an app that not only allows you to take notes but also helps you manage tasks and schedule your activities. By identifying the specific functionalities you require, you can narrow down your options and find an app that meets your needs comprehensively.\nTo illustrate this, let's consider an example. Imagine you're a busy professional who needs a note-taking app that seamlessly integrates with your task management and scheduling. In this case, you would want an app that allows you to jot down important notes, create to-do lists, and even set reminders for upcoming deadlines or meetings. By defining the scope of your requirements, you can focus your search on apps that offer these combined features.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefine the quantity.\nNow that you have identified the scope of your needs, it's important to be realistic about the quantity of apps you are willing to use within that scope. While it may be tempting to search for an all-in-one app that covers every aspect you desire, it's crucial to understand that such a comprehensive solution may not exist or may not meet all your requirements effectively.\nTo put things into perspective, let's consider an example. Imagine you are a creative individual who wants to have a note-taking app for jotting down ideas, a task management app for organizing your project deadlines, a separate app for scheduling your appointments, and another app for mood boarding. In this case, it would be unrealistic to expect a single app to fulfill all these diverse needs efficiently.\nBy being realistic and understanding that you may need to use multiple apps to cover all the functionalities you require, you can make a more informed decision and find the best combination of apps that work seamlessly together. Remember, it's about finding the right tools that enhance your productivity and meet your specific needs, even if it means using different apps for different purposes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequirements\nNow you need to define the requirements for the app category you are exploring.\nOnce you have a clear understanding of the app category you are interested in, it's essential to define the specific requirements you have for that category. These requirements will serve as your criteria for evaluating and selecting the right app for your needs.\nLet's take the example of a note-taking app. Here are a few possible requirements you might have:\n\nNo visible markdown ever: If you prefer a more intuitive and user-friendly interface, you may want to avoid apps that rely heavily on markdown formatting. Look for apps that allow you to focus on your content without the distractions of visible markdown codes.\nCloud sync native to the app: For seamless access to your notes across multiple devices, it's important to choose an app that offers built-in cloud synchronization. This ensures that your notes are automatically updated and accessible from anywhere, anytime.\nWeb app and mobile apps: If you work on both your computer and mobile devices, you may require an app that offers a web version along with dedicated mobile apps. This allows you to access and edit your notes conveniently, regardless of the device you are using.\nOffline functionality: Consider whether you need an app that allows you to access and edit your notes even when you don't have an internet connection. Offline functionality can be crucial for those moments when you're in transit or in areas with limited connectivity.\n\nBy clearly defining your requirements, you can easily filter through the available options and focus on apps that meet your specific needs. Remember, everyone's requirements may vary, so it's important to prioritize what matters most to you in an app.\n\n\nPrioritize and annotate your requirements.\nTo make an informed decision when choosing an app, it's important to prioritize your requirements based on their importance to you. This will help you determine which features are essential, which ones you want, and which ones are nice to have. Additionally, creating a tool score column will enable you to compare and evaluate different apps based on these priorities.\nLet's continue with the note-taking app example and prioritize the requirements:\na. Need (1): No visible markdown ever - This requirement is crucial for you, as you prefer a clean and distraction-free interface for your note-taking. Apps that fulfill this requirement should be given the highest priority.\nb. Want (2): Cloud sync native to the app - While cloud synchronization is important for accessing your notes across devices, it may not be an absolute necessity. Apps that provide this feature can be considered, but they can be ranked slightly lower in priority compared to the \"need\" requirement.\nc. Good to Have (3): Web app and mobile apps, and Offline functionality - These requirements are desirable but not essential. Having a web app and dedicated mobile apps, as well as the ability to access notes offline, would enhance your user experience, but they can be considered lower priority compared to the previous requirements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscover potential tools/apps\nTo find potential apps that align with your requirements, it's helpful to seek recommendations from others or explore dedicated resources. For note-taking apps, you can ask for recommendations from friends, colleagues, or online communities. Additionally, you can refer to reliable sources like @noteappsinfo on Twitter for feature suggestions and reviews.\nFor the sake of this example, let's assume you have followed the previous steps and have identified your requirements for a note-taking app. Now, it's time to choose three promising options to further evaluate. It's worth noting that this step is often referred to as the \"cold start problem\" in the computer science world, where you have limited information to begin with.\nBased on your requirements, you can choose three note-taking apps that seem to meet your needs. These could be apps that have been recommended to you or ones that you came across during your research. Remember, they don't have to be the final choices, but rather three options to start with.\nFor instance, considering the requirements you mentioned earlier, you might choose the following apps as your initial options:\n\nApp A: This app meets your \"no visible markdown ever\" requirement and offers native cloud synchronization. It also provides web and mobile apps, along with offline functionality.\nApp B: Although it doesn't fully meet the \"no visible markdown ever\" requirement, it does offer native cloud sync, web and mobile apps, and offline functionality.\nApp C: This app fulfills all your requirements, including \"no visible markdown ever,\" native cloud sync, web and mobile apps, and offline functionality.\n\nBy selecting these three promising options, you can now move on to the next step and evaluate each app based on your requirements and tool scores. Completing these five steps within a weekend will help you make an efficient decision and find the most suitable app for your note-taking needs.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, let's be fair here. None of the note-taking apps I've tried so far have managed to fulfill all of my requirements. For instance, Notion falls short when it comes to offline functionality, and the mobile apps for Remnote and Logseq aren't as useful as I'd hoped. However, despite these limitations, they do offer enough features to make them worth considering."

    "title": "How to Choose Your Note-Taking App",
    "section": "Evaluation",
    "text": "Evaluation\nNow, let's move on to the evaluation phase. Whether you're starting fresh with a new note-taking app or considering switching from your current one, the evaluation process remains the same.\nWhen evaluating the different apps, it's important to consider two main factors: the time spent with tools in that category (requirements) and the time you've spent with the specific tool you're evaluating (checks).\nTo begin, I recommend spending the next 30 days exploring and using the three note-taking apps you've chosen. You don't have to try everything at once, but try to engage in similar activities across all three apps. For example, if you're looking to journal, take some time to journal in each app and see if any of them click with you.\nWhy 30 days? Well, this timeframe allows you to get a hang of each tool and truly understand their features and functionalities. It's long enough to give you a solid grasp, but not too long that you end up collecting an overwhelming amount of data, making it difficult to switch later on.\nDuring these 30 days (or up to 90 days if you prefer), it's essential to refine your list of requirements and fill in the tool score column for each requirement. Take a look at your initial requirement list from step 3 and see if there's anything you need to add, remove, or change in terms of priority.\nFor example, you may realize that you don't care as much about offline mode because you can tolerate an hour of the service being offline once every 3-4 months. Or perhaps you discover that you need a feature like single page sharing because you often find yourself sharing information with your peers, partner, or advisor.\nBy continuously refining and updating your requirement list, you'll be able to narrow down your choices and find the note-taking app that best suits your needs. Remember, this evaluation process is all about finding the perfect fit for you!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssign Tool Scores\nOnce you have refined your requirement list, it's time to assign a tool score to each app based on how well they meet those requirements. This score should be on a scale of 0 to 1, indicating the ease or difficulty of performing a specific task.\nHere's a suggested scale you can use, but feel free to modify it to suit your preferences:\n0 - Nope! The app doesn't fulfill the requirement at all.\n0.25 - Very, very poorly. The app barely meets the requirement and is challenging to use.\n0.5 - Plugin/workaround. The app does not have a native feature for the requirement, but there are ways to achieve it using plugins or workarounds.\n0.75 - Mostly works. The app meets the requirement for the most part but may have minor limitations or inconveniences.\n1 - Yup! The app fully satisfies the requirement without any issues.\nAs you evaluate each app, assign the corresponding tool score for each requirement. This will help you objectively compare the apps and determine which one aligns best with your needs and preferences. Don't forget to update your scores as you continue to use and explore the apps over the evaluation period.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMake a decision\nDuring my initial evaluation of note-taking tools, I quickly realized that I needed a feature like block or page mentions with synced blocks. This requirement became a priority for me, and as a result, Walling was immediately eliminated from my list since it didn't offer this functionality.\nNow that you have refined your needs and wants, it's time to choose a single app or a combination of apps that best meet your requirements. If you opt for a combination of apps, it's crucial to have a clear purpose in mind for each app. For example, you might decide that App A1 will be dedicated to everything related to X, while App A2 will be used for tasks or content of type Y.\nBy narrowing down your choices and having a fixed (or a fixed set) of apps, you can streamline your note-taking process and ensure that your content is organized effectively. This will help you stay focused and maximize the benefits of using the chosen app(s) for your specific needs."

    "title": "How to Choose Your Note-Taking App",
    "section": "Checks",
    "text": "Checks\nNow, let's shift our focus to the checks you should conduct during your evaluation process.\nThere are three major checks that I recommend:\n\nAccessibility: Consider whether you find it easy to enter information into the chosen app. Ask yourself if the thought of needing to open the app and add information discourages you from doing so. The app should be accessible and user-friendly, making it effortless for you to input and store your notes.\nStability: Evaluate the app's stability by examining how often it remains unbroken. A reliable note-taking app should function smoothly and rarely encounter technical issues. It's important to choose an app that consistently works well without frequent crashes or glitches.\nUsability: Remember that a note-taking system is only as good as the information you can retrieve from it. Assess how easily you can retrieve the information you need from the app. Can you quickly search for and find specific notes or content? The app should offer a seamless and efficient user experience for retrieving your stored information.\n\nTo ensure that you maintain an effective note-taking system, continue evaluating your chosen app at regular intervals that you decide. It could be monthly, yearly, or any timeframe that suits you best. During these evaluations, repeat the assessment of your requirements and checks to see if the app continues to meet your needs.\nIf you come across a new and shiny app that catches your attention, give it a try for a weekend or a short period of time. Compare it against your evaluation metrics and see if it satisfies more of your higher-priority requirements with a better workability score. Additionally, consider the stability of the company behind the app, ensuring that they have a solid reputation and are likely to provide continued support.\nIf the new app fulfills more of your requirements with a higher score than your current tool, it may be worth considering a switch. However, don't be surprised if the new shiny tool falls short of meeting your actual needs and usage patterns. Sometimes, the tools that seem enticing at first glance may not align with your specific requirements and preferences.\n\nIt may not fit\nLet me give you an example of how this evaluation process works in practice. I discovered Capacities after already using Notion and Readwise for some time.\nUsing a reader tool became my second priority requirement. However, I found that Reader integrates seamlessly with Notion, not Capacities. While Capacities offers some amazing features that I love, such as embedded pages, a side pane, and the ability to create objects anywhere, it falls short in two areas that are high priorities for me: single page sharing and API integration.\nAlthough I'm drawn to Capacities for its unique capabilities, it doesn't fulfill my specific needs when it comes to sharing content with others or integrating with other tools via API. As much as I appreciate Capacities' features, I decide to stick with Notion since it aligns better with my highest priority items.\nIt's important to evaluate whether a tool meets your most critical requirements. Making an informed decision based on your priorities ensures that you choose a tool that truly addresses your specific needs and preferences.\n\n\nWhy not write everything in markdown\nNow let's discuss the question of why not write everything in markdown.\nWhile some people prefer writing in markdown due to its simplicity and portability, switching to a markdown-based note-taking system can be a significant decision, especially if you value consistent UI/UX.\nThere are a few reasons why someone might choose not to write everything in markdown:\n(a) Personal Preference: Markdown may not be everyone's cup of tea. Some individuals simply dislike using markdown syntax and find it cumbersome or less intuitive compared to a more visually-oriented editor.\n(b) UI/UX Considerations: Markdown-based note-taking apps often have a more code-like appearance, resembling text editors such as VS Code. For those who prefer a different aesthetic or a more polished user interface, markdown may not be the ideal solution.\n(c) File Management: Writing in markdown typically involves working with local files, which may require manual organization and maintenance. This can be a hassle for individuals who prefer a more streamlined and centralized approach to note-taking, where files are managed within a dedicated app rather than as separate files on their computer.\nFurthermore, even when using markdown files, interoperability between different markdown-based note-taking apps is not always seamless. For instance, if someone uses both Logseq and Obsidian in the same directory, they may encounter challenges with syncing, linking, or rendering certain markdown elements consistently between the two apps.\nUltimately, it's crucial to consider your own preferences, workflow, and the specific features and functionalities you require when deciding whether to write everything in markdown or opt for a different note-taking app that aligns better with your needs and desired user experience."

Once you've made your choice, continue evaluating it regularly to ensure it continues to serve your needs effectively.\nBy refining your requirements, assigning tool scores, and conducting checks on accessibility, stability, and usability, you can make an informed decision on which app to use. Don't be swayed by shiny new tools that may not fulfill your actual needs. Stay true to what works best for you and your note-taking process.\nSo, go ahead, pick your tool, and embark on a journey of continuous evaluation and improvement. Happy note-taking!"

I have several reasons for liking Google Workspace: it functions offline, almost everyone has a Google account, and its integration with Bard is seamless. Features such as toggles, previews, markdown-based writing, and rich text are also invaluable. The tasks functionality, although not free, is impressive as they can be linked with Google tasks, mentioned in chats, and synced from documents. I find Sheets+API information straightforward, and the ease of handling data through inline dropdowns & places is superior to Notion. Its offline capability, compatibility with Google Calendar, Meet, Keep, Google Apps Script, Gmail integrations, outline on the side pane, and summary are features I truly adore.However, there are some areas where Google Workspace falls short for me. I prefer the toggles in Notion, as Google Docs' toggles are restricted to headings. The use of embeds, callouts, and block-based editors is something I am accustomed to and enjoy in Notion. I miss features like synced blocks and block mentions, and I'm not a fan of viewing Google Drive as a cluttered space with numerous files. Notion's user experience, especially when opening a page with the same sidebar, feels more cohesive. Another concern is the storage aspect; uploading to Google consumes my storage while Notion offers it for free. I'm more familiar with the Notion API, making it easier for me than Google Docs API. Public content presentation in Notion also feels superior to GDocs.Perhaps in the future, if I become more comfortable with the editor and the absence of certain block features, I might reconsider Google Workspace. It encompasses many features I desire from Notion, particularly task collection and an advanced AI search via Bard for GDrive. This post did enlighten me: if I could ever tolerate the sight of 10k randomly scattered files, Google Workspace would be my go-to. Surprisingly, I even prefer it over Obsidian, which further narrows down my options.\n        \n        \n      \n      \n      \n        Notion\n        Tasks\n        Tools\n        Google Workspace\n        \n    \n\n  \n    \n        10-05-2023\n      \n      \n      \n        The Importance of Accessibility as a Default\n      \n      \n        Embracing Accessibility from the Start\n      \n      \n        I think it is the concept of defaults. If you have time to add cute animations, you have time to make it accessible.As someone who never thought about accessibility when I was in India, it took me time to come around to the idea that accessibility needs to be the default.For example, yes, looking for color blind palettes and textures adds time to your graphing process, but that time should have been factored in.Considering non-color blind friendly graphs as a completed task was the problem for me. 😅\n        \n        \n      \n      \n      \n        Tools\n        Opinion\n        \n    \n\n  \n    \n        10-03-2023\n      \n      \n      \n        Give Your Chrome the Vertical Tabs It Deserves!\n      \n      \n      \n        \n      \n      \n        If you use Chrome and envy the vertical tabs that Arc has, I just modified a few lines in Polychrome to support side panel: here.Supports tab groups, multiple windows, search, drag and drop, pinned tabs, and duplicate tabs removal!\n        \n        \n      \n      \n      \n        Tools\n        \n    \n\n  \n    \n        10-01-2023\n      \n      \n      \n        The Struggle with Information Consumption\n      \n      \n        A Reflection on Diverse Information Interaction\n      \n      \n        It has been so darn irritating realizing that I click on, consume, understand, think about, create, and recall information in different ways.This is possibly the most irritating realization I have had about myself.

And it really makes it much more unlikely for me to sketchnote, which honestly is sad. What I actually like consuming information from are infographics or supporting images, not icons.But, sketchnotes serve a different purpose for me. I don't know what part of sketchnotes makes me want to click on the link so much, but I do not actually want to learn or read the illustration? (Or maybe it is just that I have run out of ADHD meds at the moment, and have 0 visual focus, but that's unlikely).They are so irresistible for my mind. It's very much as if my mind goes Oooh, a pretty well thought-out illustration, that must have required so much effort. Let's click the link and read the article. They are the definition of possibly me judging a book by its cover.\n        \n        \n      \n      \n      \n        Sketchnoting\n        Art\n        Reading\n        \n    \n\n  \n    \n        09-06-2023\n      \n      \n      \n        Trying the Horse Browser\n      \n      \n        A Perfectly Functional Tool I'm Not Using\n      \n      \n        Ever so often, I come across an app, I think I need, and it works perfectly, but I end up not needing it, at least not in the way I thought I'd need it. The latest app in the list is browser.horse, thanks to PascalPixel who very kindly allowed me to test the app a few months back. Browser horse claims to do one thing: create trail-like navigation structure to your tabs. And it does it perfectly.On the worst of days, I have had 200+ tabs open in Horse; on the best, at least a 100. And it has been pretty stable for all of it. It is especially useful for situations where I open multiple references from a paper; if I'm deep diving into that paper. It feels like creating a flowchart, but in your browser.So, why don't I use it? Tree-based navigation is not a new paradigm. SigmaOS and Stack_HQ are two other main browser apps that do something similar. And my lack of usage is not due to the shortcomings of browser horse; but rather due to my browsing pattern.Anything I browse does not get added to Google browsing history (and I want that - Yes, I know the privacy concerns; and I choose convenience and recall)Lack of extensions, so I cannot quick add to readwise, copy all links, quick add to todoist etc.But most importantly, I realized that I'm not really looking for an origin → tree structure when I want tab organization (aka trails).Unfortunately, I am often deep diving into multiple parent papers/objects with overlapping concepts; and that is where the pattern breaks. I am looking for auto-organize and auto-deduplicate based on set of NLP kind filters. If paper on A; ≤3 months, group it.I have multiple parent saplings and have overlapping leaves; with weird usage constraints - and if you don't have those; you'll enjoy Horse. It of course has some drawbacks - I wish it had full support for extensions + customizable navigation.I, personally, won't pay for a browser, but if that is something that you're open to; and you often find yourself dead in 200 tabs, you should see if Horse is up your alley.\n        \n        \n      \n      \n      \n        Tools\n        Reading\n        \n    \n\n  \n    \n        08-29-2023\n      \n      \n      \n        My Approach to Reading and Note-Taking\n      \n      \n        I Don't Take Notes for 90% of My Reading\n      \n      \n        I have three reading models: Skimming (50%)Reading for pleasure (40%)Understanding and dissecting a research paper (10%) Contrary to popular advice, I don't take any notes for the first two categories, which make up 90% of my reading. I simply highlight and quote. Oh, and I also don't do booknotes. When reading on my Kindle, I sometimes highlight stuff and sync it through Readwise. I don't do podcast notes either, opting for podcast snips instead. For the 3rd model, most of my 'note-taking' is actually replaced by AI extraction. For example, I ask what the Research Questions (RQs) are in a particular paper. The only notes I do write are focused on processes (how to do something), understanding (what's involved), or questions/ideas related to my work. For me, any other written notes just serve as search pointers. I do write a lot outside of note-taking, like blogs, journals, letters, and academic papers.\n        \n        \n      \n      \n      \n        Reading\n        Notes\n        \n    \n\n  \n    \n        08-29-2023\n      \n      \n      \n        Micro-Blogging: Twitter to Quarto\n      \n      \n        Posting to Twitter's AND a self-hosted YAML and HTML solution.\n      \n        \n      \n      \n        I decided in May to start micro-blogging on my own website here. But as I've mentioned before, I'm not a fan of writing in markdown. Quarto offers a combination of md, html, and yaml, which works for me. So, now I write my initial thoughts on Twitter and then clean them up into YAML format. It is heavily inspired by stream.thesephist.com. It serves as a timeline of my thoughts.

I don't need the app to tell me what to write next. What I'm looking for is an app that suggests changes like, 'This needs rephrasing to connect well to another section,' or 'Merge these two repeated sections.' I think my gripe with AI writing tools is that they're very generative rather than being aids for editing. It's like someone misunderstood the term generative AI and decided that content generation is its best use. But writing a 5k+ token paper in my voice? That's a whole other ball game. It would need a strong mix of vectorization, concept mapping, segmentation, and context addition to be truly helpful as an editor. I understand that achieving this level of sophistication is extremely difficult. Still, I find myself continually trying out these tools, secretly hoping for a miracle because, let's face it, I hate editing.\n        \n        \n      \n      \n      \n        Tools\n        PKM\n        Question\n        \n    \n\n  \n    \n        08-22-2023\n      \n      \n      \n        WatchOS Blows WearOS Out of the Water in App Choices\n      \n      \n        Struggling to find useful apps on WearOS?

I generally don't write about apps unless I've spent some quality time with them. The core concept of Superlist is like if Notion or Apple Notes had calendar views, scheduling, and checkbox assignments. It reminds me a lot of ColumnsApp. What I appreciate about it is the focus on collaboration; I can't really work with a personal to-do app. Plus, it's multi-platform, which is a must for me. On the integrations side, it's decent; my go-to app, Todoist, doesn't offer much beyond Google Calendar integration.Tasks, Notes (including files and attachments), and Comments are all centralized, which is honestly fantastic. This is the core reason I wanted to check out Superlist, and it delivers. The UI for managing tasks, comments, scheduling, tags, and lists is really well done. Everything shows up in an Inbox that can be filtered, scheduled, and tagged, making task management a breeze.So why am I not committed yet? The app lacks export options, activity logs, watch apps, task statuses beyond a basic checkbox, quick capture options (Todoist really spoiled me there), limited keyboard shortcuts, and doesn't display subtask progress. It also has some syncing issues similar to Todoist. Despite these drawbacks, I think it's a pretty solid app. It treats tasks as first-class citizens, unlike many note-taking apps, while still maintaining a lot of to-do app features. Once it's out of beta, I think it's going to attract a lot of attention. I'm eager to see how it evolves.\n        \n        \n      \n      \n      \n        Notes\n        Tasks\n        Tools\n        \n    \n\n  \n    \n        08-05-2023\n      \n      \n      \n        Notion vs Apple Notes: You're Comparing Apples to Oranges\n      \n      \n        Why Notion and Apple Notes Serve Different Purposes\n      \n      \n        Unpopular opinion: If you say Notion is overrated, I use Apple Notes, it is not Notion which is the problem, it is you.This is very much like saying trains are overrated, I use cars. Yes, they are in the same general vicinity, but they are not for the same purposes. If you want local first, write in plain text, why would you use Notion. You can try Bear or Reflect or Craft, but Notion is like fitting a square peg solution in a round hole of needs. Upgrading to a premium round peg is the solution.If you're looking to level up your Apple notes experience, but do not collaborate, try Bear or maybe Reflect. Or for collaboration, Google Docs or Google Keep or Craft for that matter. Choose an app that does 10% over the app you are using. Try electric cars not trains.All arguments about Notion vs Apple Notes to me sound like I was using a round peg that fits into a round hole. Instead of upgrading my round peg, I decided to use a square peg that kinda fits into a round hole.

A significant factor is definitely collaboration. That's why I believe non-collaborative PKMs won't overtake any non-collaborative software. But what else is there?\n        \n        \n      \n      \n      \n        Notion\n        PKM\n        Tools\n        \n    \n\n  \n    \n        08-01-2023\n      \n      \n      \n        Rethinking My Newsletter Subscriptions\n      \n      \n      \n      \n        I need to have a Readwise Reader cleanup day and unsubscribe to all newsletters that I have subscribed to. I realized I do not really like newsletters written as newsletters. I like long detailed essays, and newsletters aren't that. In general, I am not gonna subscribe to scheduled newsletters anymore. Scheduled letters make it so that someone needs to have something to say; and I kinda don't enjoy that content.\n        \n        \n      \n      \n      \n        PKM\n        \n    \n\n  \n    \n        08-01-2023\n      \n      \n      \n        My Hunt for the Perfect WYSIWYG Website Editor\n      \n      \n        Experimenting with Various Website Builders for Academic Sites\n      \n      \n        Thinking about simple WYSIWYG website editors (markdown acceptable) to create personal academic websites?

Montaigne.io is quick and creates a very presentable website, highly recommend!Notion to Astro blog is awesome, but I unfortunately do not know Astro and need help customizing it. Quarto is good if you are okay with writing everything on your local machine. Git-based CMS like Decap CMS and TinaCMS are good options for a WordPress-like experience. Google Sites is fine if you're okay with your content potentially being lost. Astro with Dark Matter is good if you are comfortable with Astro.

Here's what I discovered:1. Montaigne is quick with Apple Notes and creates a presentable site.2. Notion to Astro blog by otoyo0122 is excellent for basic blogs.3. Publii is an open-source CMS that integrates well with Github Pages or Netlify. Primo is another visual website builder that's open-source.4. Quarto requires local writing, but has many templates. Quartz integrates well with Obsidian.5. Git-based CMS options like Decap_CMS and tinacms provide a WordPress-like experience. Nuxt Studio is a new git-based visual CMS.6. Google Sites is a WYSIWYG option but you don't own the content.7. Astro with Dark Matter are for those familiar with Astro.8. Editable.website is feature-rich but complex.9. Hugo (Paper Mod) and Jekyll are for those who are tech-savvy.10. Paid options: blot.im (which I highly recommend, you still own your content!), Pagy, Wordpress, Webflow, and Wix.\n        \n        \n      \n      \n      \n        Tools\n        Website\n        \n    \n\n  \n    \n        07-28-2023\n      \n      \n      \n        I just realized why I struggle so much with new note-taking apps\n      \n      \n        I cannot think and type at the same time!\n      \n      \n        Something just clicked for me right now, at midnight. I can't think and type at the same time. I can think and blabber out loud, even though blabbering is slower, but it's not enough of a difference to hamper my thinking.This is similar to how reading out loud makes some people struggle with processing what they are reading, especially when their internal reading doesn't match the speed of their speaking abilities. But blabbering produces a huge wall of text, just like this one!It gets even worse when I am reading a paper, for example, and I have thoughts about parts of it. In an ideal world, I will circle them, scribble around for context, but cropping them and typing out my comment 100% breaks the flow for me. And I can't read and process huge walls of text.This is what I've been struggling with. This is why I scribble down stuff because scribbling down with colors and pens in a spatial manner makes it way easier for me to relate stuff, to pick bits and pieces that would go together. It makes it easy for me to read and process it once I am done with the dumping. Unfortunately, it makes it harder for me later organize it, search it, or document it.I don't know how I had this realization, but it is so fascinating and disappointing at the same time.\n        \n        \n      \n      \n      \n        Tools\n        PKM\n        Note Taking\n        \n    \n\n  \n    \n        07-25-2023\n      \n      \n      \n        I tried using Obsidian and failed\n      \n      \n        I really cannot do note-taking apps that aren't true WYSIWYG\n      \n      \n        Obsidian has a live preview option that lets me see everything rendered except for the line I'm editing. This really bothers me. It feels like writing a paper in LaTeX, which I don't enjoy. For me, note-taking needs to be enjoyable. It should be free from wild context shifts, messy layouts, and metadata clutter. I even struggle with simple tasks like having differently colored highlights without them showing up as text. So, it's just not going to work for me.\n        \n        \n      \n      \n      \n        Tools\n        PKM\n        \n    \n\n  \n    \n        07-20-2023\n      \n      \n      \n        After 3 years of trying to consolidate apps, I am now separating them\n      \n      \n        Everything in one app serves me till it does not.\n      \n      \n        I am one of those people who cannot handle multiple apps that do the same thing. Whether they are for personal or professional use, if both apps are about tasks, then it's really tough for me to use both. However, I've realized that I can manage multiple apps if they serve very specific, compartmentalized purposes. For example, I want my journal and personal databases to be interconnected, but do I really need my shopping list to be linked up? It serves no purpose being in my PKM app. Take bookmarks, for instance. It's quite a hassle to have bookmarks in Notion, and I'm considering alternatives like Chrome bookmarks or Raindrop. So, in short, it's all about compartmentalizing your digital life to make things less complicated. \n        \n        \n      \n      \n      \n        Tools\n        PKM\n        \n    \n\n  \n    \n        07-12-2023\n      \n      \n      \n        I'll be avoiding switching my PKM till AI integrations are finalized\n      \n      \n        Based on my experience with Notion, I have quickly realized, I do not really like how Notion handles pages. But I am waiting to switch.\n      \n      \n        There's obviously a hint of a struggle within me; I really like Notion and don't want to leave. My hesitation mainly comes from a keen interest in how different apps are going to integrate AI. To me, the low-hanging fruit of integration, like synthesis during content creation, is incredibly dull. I absolutely don't care about it. What I'm truly waiting for is to see how these apps will handle the transformation of unstructured content into structured forms and semantic searches.\n        \n        \n      \n      \n      \n        Notion\n        \n    \n\n  \n    \n        06-28-2023\n      \n      \n      \n        Unintentionally avoiding Notion\n      \n      \n      \n      \n        I've been using Notion primarily for long-form documents that have properties. So, for anything that requires extended content, Notion works fine for me.  However, when it comes to tasks, journalling, or lists, I find myself unintentionally avoiding the platform. I really dislike using Notion for tasks. Writing a 'done' list feels like a chore, and linking pages feels pointless because that information just seems to disappear. And yeah, that makes me kind of sad.\n        \n        \n      \n      \n      \n        Notion\n        PKM\n        Tasks\n        \n    \n\n  \n    \n        06-02-2023\n      \n      \n      \n        New project launch by Notion\n      \n      \n        The main concern is that current databases cannot be ported over to this new feature. And I am kinda okay with it?\n      \n      \n        I think it's a new user onboarding feature. It's kinda similar to buying templates from people, just that this one is made by Notion and has some features inbuilt. This feature isn't really meant for people who customize their systems heavily or for those who already have established systems.One way to approach this is by asking myself: Do I want this company to make money and stay alive? If the answer is yes, I just make peace with it. On the other hand, if I don't like the direction things are taking, I look for an alternative.It's worth noting that if companies don't focus on making money, they often end up shutting down. And here I am, working in research and choosing to make less money in return for increased, well, let's call it misery.\n        \n        \n      \n      \n      \n        Notion\n        \n    \n\n  \n    \n        05-31-2023\n      \n      \n      \n        Nothing comes close to Muse\n      \n      \n        Muse recently launched their Muse for teams and I have two wishes.

I got ahead of myself.\n\nNotion Setup\nLet’s first talk about the template itself.\nIt consists of 2 databases:\n\n\n\nThe resume information (MEOW| Resume Database)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe resume structure (MEOW| Resume Database Formatting)\n\n\nWhat do they do?\nMEOW| Resume Database Formatting Database tells you which sections there are.\nIt has just 7 properties: - Name (name of the section) - Sort By (time end or start) - Sort Direction (ascending or descending) - Rank (Order in which you want sections) - Item Format (Individual item formats) - Section Format (Start and end of section formatting) - MEOW| Resume Database (Related resume items/entries)\nItems are placed inside section format using NP:Items.\nItem Properties inside the format are referred by NP:Property_Name\n\n\n\nHow Items and Property Names are used for formatting\n\n\nMEOW| Resume Database includes each item.

As you can see, the pricing here is not indicative of the time I would need to spend, with your app or course (other than the call version, where it would be 30 minutes on top of usage), but rather how much I would have to plan and prepare for the output. If you have a free app that you think I’d be interested in, feel free to shoot me a message. If it’s something I’m testing for personal use, I might do detailed scribbles for free. I’m not willing to pay to test apps.\nOn my main account, I do provide some consultancy from a research perspective (fine-tuning vs in-context learning, preference learning, generation evaluation, and verification), priced significantly higher (starting at $500/hour). You can contact me if that is something you are looking for, and we can switch over to talking on my main account, if there’s a fit, so that you can be confident of my expertise.\n\nIf I have done it for free before, why am I charging for it?\nI think my main thought process is monetizing some aspect of the service (I am usually paid upwards of $100 an hour for group user voice sessions by Big Tech companies). Secondly, it’s also a time constraint and an action constraint. If you want screenshots, annotations as to what works, what doesn’t, details, etc., and you want them within a certain time limit, I need to mentally make space for it. If that isn’t what you need, you can just ask for a basic no-deadline scribble for free, as has always been the case."

    "text": "What I can help with?\nIf you’re looking for a pro-user who likes to figure things out on her own, you’d most likely benefit from my feedback. I can test usability, onboarding, and the general use case of your app. I don’t approach it from the perspective of testing stated features. I usually go about it like this: I have X and Y use cases, so I’m looking for an app that fulfills them, and I envision using the app to fill a particular gap or replace a current tool.\n\nMy Use-Case Driven Scribbles\nThis is also why I can’t test/do scribbles for apps that I presently have no use case for. You’d be better served by going to someone else who either has that use case or is solely aiming to test features.\nUse-case/problem-driven testing and onboarding also imply that I have a certain outcome in mind, and I will mention any hurdles that come with that use case. I make sure to be very specific and define the constraints under which I am testing something—so as to not imply a general perspective. We can talk about whether this matches when you first reach out to me.\n\n\nYour Feature Driven Scribbles\nAnother kind of scribble I can do is test what you are asking me to judge an app for, where I set my use case to be the one that your target customer’s looks like. I can do that pretty well, because as an academic researcher, I review as a job, and I am used to seeing things from other people’s perspectives. And I am good at it. I will mention though, in such cases, I am still a proxy case study, and you are seeing through the lens of a customer who is aiming to be what you need, rather than one who is what you need.\n\n\nFeatures I index on for long term usage\nMulti-platform is important for me. Even though I’ve been Apple ecosystem-only for the past year, I don’t plan to remain in that state. So, most apps that are single-ecosystem-only...\nIf it’s a productivity app, I heavily index on collaboration. I don’t need team spaces or permissions, but I don’t work in isolation. So anything that is single-person use only is already something I can’t use for a long time.\nIf it’s a single-person use app, I really need to see an export option. I’m not keen on the idea of app lock-ins; even basic CSV export options are fine for many apps, in my opinion.\n\n\nFeatures I test but do not have personal use case for\nI don’t care much about E2E, local-first apps, and markdown. Specifically, I have a special dislike for visible markdown in editors, and yes, as someone who uses VS Code 8 hours a day and codes for 10 hours a day, I still can’t bring myself to like markdown for long-form writing.\n\n\nI know how LLMs perform\nIf you have an AI app that isn’t aiming to just be a direct RAG, or text generation, and is instead doing something cool with it, I would love to beta test it. This is not only from the perspective of a direct user, but also from the perspective of someone who has worked in the field of NLP for 9+ years and knows the ins and outs of how LLMs perform at various tasks. I can advise on whether you need guardrails, whether there are edge cases you haven’t considered, and so on.\nOn my main account, I do provide some consultancy from a research perspective (fine-tuning vs in-context learning, preference learning, generation evaluation, and verification), priced significantly higher (starting at $500/hour). You can contact me if that is something you are looking for, and we can switch over to talking on my main account, if there’s a fit, so that you can be confident of my expertise."

    "text": "Why I Might Not Be a Good Fit?\n\nPrice sensitive\nI am very price-sensitive. I live in the US, but a lot of the work I do is collaborative, which involves multiple people using a software. I will 100% judge the utility of the app based on its cost. For reference, my subscription-based apps are: Readwise (for Reader), Spotify, Netflix, Google One, iCloud, ChatGPT (for GPT-4), and Todoist. My particular belief is—I’m okay with paying a one-time cost in the range of $20-$30 for exceptional software, and around $4/month for apps that I use extensively (use for at least an hour a day). Any price over this, or any high margins (yes, looking at you, AI apps), and I will mention the cost—and expect a feature base that is in line with the cost.\n\n\nBeta apps and new companies\nI don’t necessarily judge apps based on how long they’ve been out. This is a common metric that people use to judge apps, but for me, I’m trying to integrate the app into my workflow. Sure, I have some apps that I keep an eye on for the future, but for me, an app is only useful if I can use it now, so I compare it to options available at the moment.\n\n\nAnimation\nAnimation is a huge sell for iOS apps. I suffer from motion sickness and use the reduce motion setting. Heavy animation bothers me much more than it entices me. However, I do love subtle, cute, or whimsical animations, and I will mention the ones that particularly made me happy!\n\n\nAI Apps\nI believe in the concept of bad GPT API wrappers and good GPT-based apps. I talk a bit about it here, but primarily, if your app calls an API and outputs text based on a template or constructed prompts, it’s very likely that my feedback won’t be overwhelmingly positive. I am still happy to talk about interactions, design, and tools, but if you’re making an AI generator for X, you’ll likely end up with a comment like this from my end.\n\n\nTesting in isolation\nI have and will always compare apps. I know that many indie hackers believe they are building in a market where multiple people can have a piece of the pie, and this is definitely true, for both indie hackers and big tech companies (or else Dropbox would not have existed). But as a consumer, or someone who chooses apps or recommends them, I will look at options and compare them. So it is likely that some of my scribbles will involve comparisons such as – look at X for feature A; I really like their implementation.\n\n\nThis ain’t necessarily marketing material\nIf you are looking for user-generated content for marketing, or looking for reviews that you can include on your homepage, I am not sure I am the right fit. It is very unlikely that my scribble will be all positive; it will definitely not be hype-y, and it won’t have any special touches that are targeted toward making it viral or quotable.\n\n\nOnboarding Calls\nI do not do onboarding calls. I just can’t do them due to time constraints and how little I get out of them. And I strongly believe that while onboarding calls are great for an average customer, it helps to know what someone experiences when they try to use your app for the first time, alone, with no onboarding sequence. Because I don’t read any onboarding sequence, and I believe I can figure stuff out."

    "section": "How?",
    "text": "How?\nSo, you might be wondering, what exactly does this automation do to streamline our bookmark management woes? Let me break it down for you:\n\n\n\nExample of self-organizing bookmarks working\n\n\n\nExtracts content of the page\nFirstly, it extracts the content of the page you’re bookmarking. It ensures that the content is fully loaded and not hindered by any pesky JavaScript issues. This way, you can rest assured that you’re capturing the complete essence of the page.\n\n\nTakes screenshot of the page using Screenia by @s_badaoui\nNext, it takes a screenshot of the page using the nifty tool called Screenia by the talented @s_badaoui. This comes in handy when the automation couldn’t fetch the content of the page earlier. In such cases, it cleverly applies OCR (Optical Character Recognition) on the captured image to extract the necessary information.\n\n\nCall OpenAI API\nBut wait, there’s more! The automation then calls the OpenAI API, which works its magic and provides a JSON file containing a summary of the page, along with relevant tags and categories. These tags and categories are selected from a pre-defined list, ensuring that your bookmarks are organized and easily searchable.\n\n\nAdd screenshot to dropbox\nNow, here comes the cool part. The automation adds the screenshot of the page to Dropbox, making it easily accessible and shareable. It then retrieves the URL of the uploaded image, so you can conveniently view and reference it whenever needed.\n\n\nParses the information\nLast but not least, the automation parses all the gathered information and seamlessly adds it to Notion. Notion acts as your centralized hub for bookmark management, allowing you to effortlessly categorize, search, and access your bookmarks with just a few clicks."

    "text": "Run this on your own\nIf you want to run this on your own, you need:\n\niOS/MacOS (because this is dependent on shortcuts app)\nNotion Integration Key\nBookmarks Database duplicated from the link below, shared with integration and then get its database ID\nOpen AI API Key\nFree Actions app by @sindresorhus [On both MacOS and iOS]\nConnect your dropbox account in shortcuts (should hopefully prompt itself)\n\nHowever, like with any automation, there are a few issues to be aware of. Let’s take a look at them:\n\nOne downside is that this automation may take some time to run. So, if you’re using it on iOS and your macOS device is in the background, you might see a spinner indicating that the process is still ongoing. Just keep in mind that it’s best not to add two bookmarks within a minute to avoid any potential conflicts.\nAnother issue to be mindful of is the rate limit of Screenia. While it’s a fantastic tool for taking screenshots, it does have its limitations. If you’re adding bookmarks at a rapid pace, you might run into the rate limit of Screenia. In such cases, you may need to wait for a while before the automation can successfully capture the screenshots.\nAh, the dreaded iOS permissions. Unfortunately, iOS has a tendency to bombard us with permission requests, and this automation is no exception. Each time you run it, you may have to deal with those annoying permission prompts. It can be quite frustrating, but don’t worry, you’re not alone in this struggle.\n\nDespite these minor hiccups, the benefits of streamlining your bookmark management with Notion and AI far outweigh the inconveniences.\nAnd finally, get the Apple Shortcut here."

    "text": "Unpopular opinion: I agree with @fortelabs here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTiago Forte talks about graph based PKM apps\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMass adoption vs niche-critical\nMass adoption of a tool is very different than “niche” critical. As someone who loves organization, I love delving into new apps. I love all the innovation that has been popping up with these apps.\n\nDefinition\nLet’s define these terms first:\n\nWhat is critical mass? That would be the amount of people using the tool needed for the toool to survive amongst the competitors in its niche areas.\nWhat is a mainstream tool? It solves a problem that people have and is something that is a go-to for solving that problem.\n\n\n\nExamples\nNow before you come at me, for all those people who love note-taking, consider this. If someone asks you for a habit tracking tool, what do you suggest? Not an “all-in-one” tool, a specific app.\nSay @Habitifyapp or @habitica?\nDo you think better habit trackers don’t exist? Or someone asks for a journal app. Not an all in one app (for all you obsidian and notion people out there), but for journaling.\nDid you suggest @dayoneapp or @myjourneyapp?\n\n\n\nWhy does the distinction matter?\nTake a moment to think about why that is the case. Why are these tools “everlasting” and popular? Give me some specific examples you say?\n@GoodNotesApp is the go-to solution to the problem of aesthetic, useful, organizable handwritten searchable notes which is why they still exist even though Apple Notes exists. @snipd_app is the go-to solution of “how do I remember what I heard” in podcasts, and hence, they are solving a “mainstream” problem. @airtable and @NotionHQ did not become popular because they were doing something “completely unexpected”.\nThey solved the problem of “how do we store data without complicated SQL?” or “what if I want to have notes for my Google Sheets?” People started using @Spotify because they did not want to buy albums and wanted good recommendations.\nImagine if spotify’s tagline was “we generate music playlists based on the mood we infer from your apple health data”, it would be cool but not mainstream. People work/think with people. How often are we in situations where we think/write/document about a “problem” start to end “alone”?\n\n\nWhat we love vs what public needs\nAnd any tool that is not collaborative or multi-platform lacks the ability to become mainstream. There is a reason @todoist is so popular. Coming back to the note-taking space. There are many features that us, note-taking people love.\nIt should have backlinks, should have markdown support, should have magical powers to transform my life when I zoom into the note-web I created. Ask any random person what they want in a note-taking app and their answer would be: frictionless adding, storage, surfacing, tagging, filtering.\nThat is why people use Apple Notes. And with minimal difference is why @evernote and @BearNotesApp became popular.\n\nLack of mainstream applications\nThe biggest problem with graph note-taking apps is the lack of “mainstream” applications.\nMost mainstream graph based explorations require automatic content extraction (for example @RsrchRabbit which looks at “graph” of academic papers).\nDo I hear you say, “but I love graphs?”. I think that is great that you do, but most people do not care about it. Most people who want a visual component to their notes, also want a visual component to the interaction, not use [[ to make a connection.\n\n\n\nWhat about spatial canvas applications?\nThat is one of the main reason why I think @MuseAppHQ, @whimsical and @scrintal are headed in the right direction of “graphs” which is more akin to “whiteboarding” something that people know, that people are used to.\nBut these are not private. They are not local. They are not based in markdown. If you want all of those, good for you.\n\n\nOlder apps are here to stay\nBut given how many people use Google Docs, MS Word and Apple Notes, it is not hard to infer that people do not care about it. Am I being delusional? I sure hope so. But more than likely, I am not.\nDo you know how many academics still use Latex and @overleaf for their papers (yes, even in CS)?\nBut even better, do you know how many use MS Word?\nYou would be surprised! In summary, all I want to say is as much as I am happy that @tana_inc exists, no it won’t kill @NotionHQ, just like Notion did not kill Google Docs.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"
